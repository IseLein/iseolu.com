If you think about Nigeria today for more than two seconds, you may be moved to tears because of how terrible things are. Insecurity, poor electricity, a sad educational system, I can go on. But I always encouraged myself knowing that very soon, things will change. There are prophetic words, the youth are rising with a mandate to turn things around. Surely, the situation won't continue to deteriorate for another hundred years. Right? I hate to be the kings doubting officer[^1], I really do. But *might these things be?* I look at the youth that should deliver us from our current captivity (myself) and I see zero signs of a reckoning. I always talk with my friends about how terrible the Nigerian government is. They are so corrupt and negligent, they deserve to be stoned to death. But that's all I do. Talk. I can't even be bothered to look up the national budget for this year. I have no idea how much the government spends on what. I don't know anything about anything beyond the headlines and the trending topics on Twitter. How do I expect to effect any change if I am so clueless. Granted, I am not the President, nor am I the minister of petroleum, so my knowledge does not really move the needle. But Nehemiah had to ask concerning the Jews to even realize that he needed to embark on a nation-building project[^2]. If I don't ask, I won't be able to arise as a young man to do anything. Any activism will be performative. This is me asking concerning my nation.

## What's up with the National Grid?
Just last year, the national grid collapsed twelve times! What does that even mean? Also, there's an exclamation mark at the end of that sentence; is twelve a crazy number of times for the national grid to collapse?
