# Trying to run for presidency at UTM Robotics.

So... I lost. Whew. I saw this coming, but it's fine. I'm not really interested in
introspecting. I just want to test this. Here's a [link](https://stephango.com/about). Does
that look good?

Here's an image

Images and links look good! *Italics* are also supported. Sometimes, that's _not_ enough.
We need to get **bold**. ~Emphasis~ is nice.

Say we wanted to use `codeblocks`. Are we cooked, chat?

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

We'll fix code later.

> How about blockquotes?

That's good enough.
